## 1. Why this PDF exists
I needed a single, short file that answers *“what the hell are you doing for 18 months?”*  
No methods, no daily tasks – just **the finish line** and **why it matters to me**.  
Everything else will be shown in real time on [YouTube / GitHub / TikTok].

## 2. Context in one breath
- High-school senior, 6-to-15 h schedule, zero allowance.  
- Hardware ceiling: Ryzen 3 3200G + Vega 8, 16 GB RAM.  
- Self-taught English, 20 push-ups max, online IQ 125-160 (take it with salt).  
- **Problem:** every “learn AI” roadmap starts with *“buy a 3060”* – I can’t.  
- **Solution:** treat brain + reputation as the GPU, monetise the delta, **then** buy the card with my own cash.

## 3. Two nested objectives

### A. Street-Level Condor Plan (months 0-18) – **the Bridge**
**Mission statement:**  
*Turn a $0 stack (integrated graphics, free Wi-Fi, school cafeteria) into ≥300 USD/month of autonomous cash-flow and a community of 10 k humans who would hire me before they hire a degree.*

**Hard finish lines:**
1. 200 random digits memorised in <5 min (Human Benchmark).  
2. 100 push-ups without break (video proof).  
3. One GPU ≥4 GB bought second-hand with *net* revenue from projects started after Day 0.  
4. Passive income ≥100 USD/mo (e-book, affiliate, micro-SaaS).  
5. GitHub repo ≥1 k commits, ≥10 k YouTube subs, ≥2 viral TikToks (>500 k views).  

**Soft finish lines:**
- Can explain any concept I used (memory palace, RLHF, soldering, LLC) to a 12-year-old.  
- HRV ↑15 %, sleep efficiency 90 %, body-fat <15 %.  
- Emergency fund: 1 k USD cash or liquid crypto.  

### B. Full Condor Plan (months 19-48) – **the Real Game**
**Mission statement:**  
*Become an individual who can reboot a technical civilisation from a shed with 30 kg of tools, or alternatively unplug an AGI without the AGI predicting it.*

**Macro finish lines (compressed):**
- Pass MIT-level finals in maths, physics, chem, bio, CS without enrolling.  
- Build a 1 kWh/day off-grid energy block, 10 L/day water purifier, 500 kcal/day food loop – **documented open-source**.  
- Train ≤1 B param model from zero on local data; quantise to run on ≤2× consumer GPUs.  
- Publish an alignment paper on arXiv; give a TEDx talk.  
- Lead a remote team of ≥5 people to ship usable open-source hardware+software in ≤6 months.  
- Final net-worth target: 10 k USD/mo automated + 100 k USD liquid by month 48.  

**Civilisation-mode check (if internet dies):**  
Can smelt aluminium, synthesise penicillin, print a 4-layer PCB, teach 30 kids to read in 30 hours, and keep 20 strangers alive for a year – **all demonstrated on camera or it didn’t happen**.

## 4. Non-objectives (to avoid scope creep)
- Drop out before graduation – only if school blocks the plan.  
- Crypto trading as main income – okay for parking value, not for producing it.  
- Power-lifting records – strength is a tool, not the trophy.  
- Follower count for its own sake – must correlate with **deliverable quality**.

## 5. Success criterion for this document
If a stranger reads this PDF, clicks one link, and **immediately understands what I’ll prove in 18 months without me speaking**, the file has served its purpose.

See you on the other side of the GPU.
